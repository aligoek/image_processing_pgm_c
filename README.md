# PGM Image Processing in C

This C program performs image processing operations on PGM (Portable Gray Map) image files, including Gaussian filtering and Laplacian edge detection.

## Features

* **PGM Image Input/Output:** Reads PGM image files and writes processed images to new PGM files.
* **Gaussian Filtering:** Applies a Gaussian blur to the image to reduce noise.
* **Laplacian Edge Detection:** Detects edges in the image using the Laplacian operator.
* **Filter Size Selection:** The program applies Gaussian filters of varying sizes.
* **Sigma Value Selection:** The program applies Gaussian filters with different sigma values.
* **Multiple Outputs:** Generates multiple output images, including Gaussian-filtered images and Laplacian-filtered images from the Gaussian-filtered results.
